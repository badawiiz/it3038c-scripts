2- You will be prompted to type in the symbol name of the currency you're looking up. Be very careful as it is case sensitive (MUST BE IN ALL CAPS). You can view all of the Symbol names that are listed in Binance.com by clicking on the 'coins.txt' file.

3- After the information is provided, you will be asked if you'd like to check a different currency or if you're done. Type 'y', or 'yes' to lookup a different currency or 'n', or 'no' to finish.
